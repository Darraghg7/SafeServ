## Local Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/safeserv.git
cd safeserv
npm install
```

### 2. Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` with values from the Supabase dashboard → **Project Settings → API**:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

> The anon key is safe to expose in the client — access control is enforced via Row Level Security policies on the database.

### 3. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 4. Build for production

```bash
npm run build   # outputs to /dist
npm run preview # serve the built output locally
```

---

## Deployment

Deployment is **fully automatic**. Pushing to `main` triggers a Vercel build and deploy with no manual steps required.

- Vercel is configured in `vercel.json` to rewrite all routes to `index.html` (required for client-side routing)
- Environment variables are set in the Vercel project dashboard (not `.env` — that's local only)

To update production env vars: Vercel dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables.

## Database Migrations

There is **no auto-migration runner**. Migrations must be applied manually via the Supabase SQL editor.

**To apply a migration:**
1. Open the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → your project → **SQL Editor**
2. Open the relevant file from `supabase/migrations/`
3. Paste and run it

Migrations are numbered sequentially (`001_`, `002_`, …). Always apply them in order. Never skip one.

### Migration history

## Authentication Model

SafeServ uses a **two-tier auth model**:

### Tier 1 — Venue owner (Supabase Auth)
- Used only at signup (`/signup`) to create a Supabase Auth account and provision the venue
- After venue creation the owner is immediately signed out of Supabase Auth
- Not used day-to-day

### Tier 2 — Staff PIN sessions (app-layer auth)
- All staff (including managers and owners) log in at `/v/:venueSlug` using a 4–6 digit PIN
- Active session stored in React context (`SessionContext`)
- No individual Supabase Auth accounts for staff — they are records in the `staff` table

**Adding new staff:** Managers add staff inside the app (Settings → Staff). No Supabase dashboard access needed.

**If a venue owner forgets their password:** Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users → find their email → Send password reset.

## Coding Conventions

- **One hook per domain** — data fetching lives in `src/hooks/use*.js`, never inline in pages
- **Tailwind dark mode** — uses `darkMode: 'class'` strategy; `dark:` variants are controlled by `html.dark` set in `ThemeContext`
- **Rules of Hooks** — all hooks must be called unconditionally at the top of a component, before any early `return` statements
- **RLS policies** — all tables have RLS enabled; the anon role is granted broad access (`USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)`) and access control is enforced at the application layer via venue scoping
- **Venue scoping** — every database query must include a `venue_id` filter; never query across venues
